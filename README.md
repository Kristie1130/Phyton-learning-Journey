Day 4 of My Python Learning Journey
Topic: Data Types & Type Conversion

Today I learned about the basic data types in Python and how Python understands different kinds of values.

📌 What I learned
Integer (int) – whole numbers

age = 22
Float (float) – decimal numbers

price = 10.5
String (str) – text

name = "Christiana"
Boolean (bool) – True or False

is_student = True
🔄 Type Conversion
I also learned how to convert one data type to another:


Day 4 learning python 

Still on phyton data types 

LIST DATA TYPE IN PHYTON 

State=["Lagos","Enugu","Rivers","Ogun")
print(State)= Lagos,Enugu,Rivers,Ogun

Student_age=('22','21','18','29')
print(Student_age)

'22','21','18','29'

Strings are continuous character held in quotation marks.
e.g "Lagos"
Country="Nigeria"
print(country)
