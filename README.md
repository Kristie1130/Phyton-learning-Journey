Day 9 – Python Learning Journey 🐍
Today, I continued building my Python skills by practicing what I’ve learned so far. I focused on strengthening my understanding of functions and loops, writing simple programs to solve real problems. I practiced using for and while loops, defined my own functions, and learned how to reuse code efficiently. I also worked on debugging errors, which helped me understand how Python executes code step by step. Each day, Python feels less intimidating and more logical. I’m gaining confidence and consistency, and this motivates me to keep learning and improving my programming skills.# Phyton-learning-Journey
# Day one: python Basics
# Topic: print Statement 

print("Hello World")
print('my name is christiana')
('Am learning python')



## Day 3 – Variables & Data Types
- Learned how to store data using variables
- Practiced strings, integers, and booleans
- Understood rules for naming variables




Day 5 of My Python Learning Journey
Topic: Data Types & Type Conversion

Today I learned about the basic data types in Python and how Python understands different kinds of values.

📌 What I learned
Integer (int) – whole numbers

age = 22
Float (float) – decimal numbers

price = 10.5
String (str) – text

name = "Christiana"
Boolean (bool) – True or False

is_student = True
🔄 Type Conversion
I also learned how to convert one data type to another:


Day 4 learning python 

Still on phyton data types 

LIST DATA TYPE IN PHYTON 

State=["Lagos","Enugu","Rivers","Ogun")
print(State)= Lagos,Enugu,Rivers,Ogun

Student_age=('22','21','18','29')
print(Student_age)

'22','21','18','29'

Strings are continuous character held in quotation marks.
e.g "Lagos"
Country="Nigeria"
print(country)


Day 6 of learning python 

In today's lesson I learnt lines splitting and splitness.

for a line of code to be divided into 2 lines or more after running it then you need to use this (\n) .
 
Example: I am Christiana a 21 years old girl in Lagos Nigeria \nI love for.
After printing this code the line will be 2 lines since it was splitted into 2


DAY 7 PYTHON LEARNING JOURNEY 


Today marks Day 7 of my Python learning journey, and I focused on bringing together what I’ve learned so far through practice and small exercises.

📌 What I Learned Today
Reviewed variables and data types (int, float, string, boolean)

Practiced user input using input()

Worked with type conversion (int(), float(), str())

Practiced basic arithmetic operations

Improved understanding of writing clean and readable code

What I Practiced
Writing simple programs that collect user input

Performing calculations based on user input

Printing clear outputs using print()

Fixing common beginner errors (syntax and type errors)

 Python Learning Journey – Day 8
Topic: Control Flow (If, Elif, Else) & Logical Thinking

What I learned today
Today, I focused on decision making in Python using if, elif, and else statements.
I learned how Python executes different blocks of code based on conditions and how this helps programs make choices.

Key concepts covered
if, elif, and else statements

Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

Logical operators (and, or, not)

Indentation and code blocks

Writing conditions that return True or False

Practice examples
Checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero

Determining if a user is eligible based on age

Simple grading system using conditions

Challenges
Understanding how multiple conditions work together was challenging at first, but practicing helped me see how Python evaluates conditions step by step.

What I improved
My logical thinking

Reading and understanding conditional statements

Writing cleaner and more readable code


MY PYTHON LEARNING JOURNEY 

DAY 10

greetings = 'Hello World!'
print(greetings)
account_balance=5000
withdrawal_amount = int(input("Enter the amount you wish to withdraw: "))
if withdrawal_amount<=account_balance:
    print("Withdrawal Successful!\nThank you for banking with us")
    
else:
    print("Your account balance is low!\n Please Fund Your Account! Thank You")
     
if greetings == "Hello World!":
    print("great")
else:
    print("You have not greeted")

I JUST DID A RANDOM WEBSITE FOR A BANK


Day 11 – Python Learning Journey 
Today I learned:
How to use functions to organize code
The difference between parameters and arguments
Writing reusable functions with return
Basic function documentation using comments
Still practicing and building consistency.
